                    "The Nipmuc Regional High School STEM Scholars Program provides our students a meaningful way to connect their experiences in Nipmuc's classrooms with universities, the community, and the workplace.  Students in the program have the opportunity to take challenging courses in STEM-related subjects, gain first-hand knowledge of STEM programming at the collegiate level, acquire skills for workplace readiness, engage in local STEM community service projects, and participate in a STEM-related career shadow experience.  The STEM program demonstrates our commitment to redesigning instruction and academic programming through the collaborative support of teachers, parents, collegiate and professional partners, and community organizations."
