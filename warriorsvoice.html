            <p>The Warrior’s Voice was the school newspaper for Nipmuc Regional High School. I worked as the lead of a small team to develop a website for the newspaper where articles could be posted. There was an additional request to also allow students to vote in polls which was also implemented. The vast majority of the website was written in HTML and CSS, which I had had prior experience in, but we also had to write a little bit of PHP so that the editors could post articles to the website easily as well as make sure that people could vote in the polls. We loaded in articles from XML files, but we ran into a lot of issues with browsers caching the pages and we spent several hours making sure that the browser wouldn’t cache pages. The website was finished and fully functioning, but the newspaper was shut down due to lack of interest. Regardless, it was great experience and we had fun making the site.</p>
