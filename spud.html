                    During the 2016-2017 school year, I have embarked on an independent study revolving around computer science and the creation of a 3D game engine. The engine will be written in C++ and will utilize several third party libraries such as OpenGL, Nvidia PhysX, FreeImage, GLFW and Boost, but all other code will be written by me. This is my second attempt at creation of a 3D game engine, my last was a project that lasted several years and was started in 2011 and was originally written in Objective-C but re-written in C++. This old engine was architecturally very flawed and the code lacked consistent nomenclature, indentation style and comments which made the codebase unmaintainable. Since then I have learned a significant amount and am much more well-equipped to give it another try.
