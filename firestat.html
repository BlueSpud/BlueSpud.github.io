           <p> In 2014, my neighbor approached me with an idea for an app. He is a part-time fireman, and when firemen have down time they go around to buildings that they anticipate they might have to fight a fire in. They then map out where important things are like the fire alarm panel, fire hydrants, gas shutoffs and other things. The problem is that this is done on paper, and they have to carry around massive, unorganized binders and sift through them in an emergency. Software exists to do this digitally, but its really expensive, and for a small town like mine, the fire department is operating under limited finances already and can’t afford it. My neighbor’s proposal was to create an affordable app that firemen could use to make preplans digitally and maybe even save lives.</p>

            <p>We worked for a few months developing Fire Stat. I wrote the code and designed the interface and my neighbor handled the feature set and the marketing. We released it initially with little success so we went back to the drawing board and completely redesigned and rewrote it from the ground up. We released Fire Stat 2.0, which was a much better application. I created a proprietary file format so firemen could all download the app and even share them between stations, completely eliminating the need for messy binders. Not only that, but they could search for the plan they wanted to get to so they didn’t have to sift through a binder, wasting minutes of precious time. I even added the ability to sort the plans by location, which meant that a fireman could pull up to a fire, pull out his phone and the plan he needed would be right at the top of the list. A map view was also included where every plan was displayed on a map and could be tapped on to pull the up.</p>

            <p> We made creating plans just as easy as viewing them. We adopted a simple drag and drop interface so it was as simple as possible. The feature to take a screenshot from the maps allowed for firemen to have a top down view of a building without even needing to have the building plans. Plans could also be tagged with extra information such as notes, a phone number and a physical location and could also be locked to prevent accidental editing. </p>

            <p> Heres a video we made to show off Fire Stat 2.0 </p>
