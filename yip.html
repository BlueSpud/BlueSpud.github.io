        <p>The Apple Watch is a great piece of technology, but it does have limited capabilities. The version of Siri on it is very watered down and will often refer you to your iPhone to do a web search if it can’t find the answer toy for question on Wolfram Alpha. This has improved, but when it first came out I was frustrated with the limited capability, so I developed Yip. Yip is an app for the Apple Watch that actually searches the internet, without needing you to transfer it to the iPhone. It can pick out “smart answers” for most questions like, “Who won the war of 1812?” or “What is a pineapple?” Whats really cool is that it can also find a relevant Wikipedia article for you and give you the entire article (yes the entire article!) right on your wrist. In my opinion this is a huge improvement over the version of Siri that will call upon the larger screen of the iPhone because it gives a concise answer that can be much more convenient than pulling out your phone.</p>

        <p>The app is no longer in active development, but you can download it here: </p>
