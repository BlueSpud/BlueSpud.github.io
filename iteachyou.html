                <p>iTeachYou was an app developed for the iPad for use in classrooms. At my high school each student received an iPad as part of The 1:1 Learning Program for use in the classroom. Teachers were instructed to use Google Classroom to manage their classroom digitally. For me, Google Classroom left a lot to be desired; it was unintuitive, it was buggy and it lacked features that seemed obvious to me. I contacted my principal and began to develop iTeachYou, which was an alternative solution for the management of the classroom online. </p>

                <p> iTeachYou was built on top of the Dropbox platform for two reasons. The first reason was that it was free and provided a large amount of storage space for students and teachers. The second reason that I chose it is because they also offered what they called a datastore API which allowed you to create databases that were invisible to the user. Unfortunately this API was discontinued at the beginning of 2016. I migrated iTeachYou to Parse and was ready to release it, but unfortunately Parse was also discontinued, so development of iTeachYou has stopped temporarily. </p> 

                <p> At its core level, iTeachYou was a way for teachers and students to send files to each other. It would allow teachers to post assignments which could contain several pieces including videos, photos, links, text and files. Students could then download the files and complete the assignment and submit it back to the teacher. All of this was done in simplicity in mind and it was made so that files could be downloaded and opened in one tap and uploaded in the fewest steps possible (I was constrained by iOSâ€™ sandboxing and lack of a file browser). Once the teacher has received a students response which can include text, links, files and videos, they can view it and send then back a grade. </p>
