            <p>Donut Fighter was an app created as a project for charity. It was developed in 2012 by myself and my father who did the 3D graphics for it. We opted for pre-rendering the graphics for simplicity, improved visual quality and performance. The game was written using Cocos2D and Objective-C and it was my first real code project. The app was listed on the app store for 99¢ and all of the proceeds were donated to St. Jude Children’s Hospital. In Donut Fighter, you square off against a 5’ 10” pink frosted donut with sprinkles. Every successful punch or kick on the donut will increase your valor, and when the bar is filled the round is won. Let the valor bar sink to zero and the donut reigns victorious. There are 10 rounds in total, with a sharp increase in difficulty around round 5.</p>
        
            <p>The app was met with success and sold in over 15 countries. The app got quite a bit of press attention too with the local newspapers picking up the story and even fox news gave me an interview. Apple also invited me to come accompany them for 3 days and give a short presentation to teachers in an event about the importance of technology in the classroom.</p>
